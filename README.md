# Gohetia_Sheldon_Crushing_Bugs

This is the repo for the Homework #2 - Crushing Bugs ( Trouble Shooting Javascripts ) for Authoring 2

## Goal is to solve these bugs and more

1.  In its current state, our puzzle game has at least a couple of bugs. You can drag and drop more than one puzzle piece into a drop zone – this shouldn’t happen. There should only be one piece in one drop zone at a time.

2.  The second bug is the problem with pieces appearing in the drop zones on reset / choosing a new puzzle. Those should be removed / reparented back to the drag zone as well, so that the player has a fresh board to drop onto.
